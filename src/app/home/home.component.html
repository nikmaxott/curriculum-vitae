      <h3 i18n class="text-lg mt-2">Superbase Shop - SaaS Shop Design</h3>
      <p>
        A project where I used Gatsby.JS to create a static site, showcasing
        several key products of the Superbase brand. This project was a nice
        challenge and a change of pace from my normal work at the time, and
        showcases my stylistic choices, preferring a minimal look.

      <h3 i18n class="text-lg mt-2">Sunnyside Agency Landing Page</h3>
      <p>
        A project challenge through Frontend Mentor, this particular project
        involved making a landing page for a fake Creative Agency called
        Sunnyside. The key deliverables where pixel perfect design replication.
        And creating a mobile friendly UI experience.

      <h3 class="text-lg mt-2">Wordpress Sites</h3>
      <div>
        <p class="mt-2">
          As part of my work at DKAVS I was responsible for several Wordpress
          Sites, allowing me the flexibility to create unique designs for each
          of the different elements of the business.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The first of these is the DKAVS Site itself which needed to make sure
          that consumers were able to quickly check on their repairs and create
          a new repair, while creating trust with the consumer using
          Testimonials.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The second of these is the Superbase site. This site needed to be
          different from the DK site as the audience was more business oriented,
          as a SaaS and Consultancy, meaning highlighting our contact and
          competencies. As well as our Unique Selling Points to drive traffic to
          one of our developers.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The final website was the SIMPOL Programming Language website. This
          was a much more blog oriented website meaning making the Quick Start
          and Documentation stand out. And ensuring that users where kept up to
          date with the latest features and libraries.
          <br />
          This website also featured a seperate forum, for which I was
          responsible for community engagement.
